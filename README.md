# Africa
Africa is SwiftUI iOS Application in which I have covered all the aspects of SwiftUI

I have used the MVVM design pattern in this SwiftUI project, and seggrate the code as folder and sub folders as per dependency.
Singleton Design pattern also used to create instance of class ones with static and use it globaly inside application.

iOS Framework
SwiftUI
MapKit
AVKit

I am fall in love with this design.
